# Vivid Clojure Maven Plugin


Integrates well with the `clojure` CLI command and its `deps.edn`.



## Development

Run the tests and build the deliverables:

```bash
bin/test.sh
```

*Motivation*: Among the methods of integration Clojure tooling into Maven, none provided the integrative experience of IntelliJ (Maven classpath) and CI (JUnit reporting).


## TODO

- Licensing: Apache and EPL dual license, attributions to donor code
- CI, Sonar, dist
- Implementation
